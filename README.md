# Python_Project_DGT300
repository to store different versions of my Python school project.

I have created a Python NCEA Level 2 and 3 quiz to test basic algebra knowledge. There will be 3 options and only one is correct. When you get an answer wrong, you will not gain any points. When you get an answer correct, you will gain one point. There are 10 questions and the score is displayed at the end of the quiz. In-depth instructions on my program Help page.
